## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Website Crawling and Flow Discovery

- The tool must crawl a specified website URL to discover user flows
- It must identify and record all possible interaction paths through the application
- It must handle forms, navigation elements, modals, and other interactive UI components
- It must be able to detect when a flow has completed (e.g., form submission confirmation)
- It must discover all possible flows in the first iteration (complete exploration)

### 1.2 Flow Analysis and Presentation

- The tool must analyze discovered flows and present them to the developer
- Each flow must be described in human-readable format
- Each flow description must include:
  - Starting point
  - Series of actions taken
  - End state
  - Pages visited
  - Key interactions performed
- Flows must be presented in a way that allows easy selection

### 1.3 Test Generation

- The tool must generate Playwright tests for selected flows
- Generated tests must follow Playwright best practices including:
  - Page Object Model pattern
  - Test independence and isolation
  - Playwright test fixtures
  - Reliable selector strategies
  - Smart waiting mechanisms
  - Error handling
- Tests must include appropriate assertions based on observed behavior
- Tests must handle data input requirements appropriately
- Output tests must be formatted consistently and include clear comments

### 1.4 Test Validation

- The tool must execute generated tests against the target environment
- It must report test execution results
- It must provide debugging information for any failed tests

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Component Architecture

1. **CLI Interface**
   - Handles command-line arguments and user interaction
   - Manages the overall execution flow
   - Presents flow options and collects user selections

2. **Web Crawler Module**
   - Utilizes browser-use for headless browser automation
   - Performs depth-first exploration of the target website
   - Records all interactions and state changes
   - Identifies form inputs and generates appropriate test data

3. **Flow Analysis Engine**
   - Processes raw crawl data to identify distinct user journeys
   - Groups related actions into coherent flows
   - Generates human-readable descriptions of each flow
   - Tags flows with metadata (pages visited, actions performed, etc.)

4. **Test Generation Engine**
   - Implements Page Object Model pattern for selected flows
   - Creates fixture-based test setup and teardown
   - Generates appropriate assertions based on observed behavior
   - Implements data parameterization where appropriate
   - Uses reliable selectors (preferably data-testid if available)

5. **Test Validation Module**
   - Executes generated tests against the target environment
   - Reports success/failure status
   - Provides debugging information for failed tests

### 2.2 Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Core Dependencies**:
  - Playwright: For browser automation and test execution
  - browser-use: For AI-driven website exploration
  - OpenAI SDK: For analyzing flows and generating test code
- **Development Dependencies**:
  - TypeScript compiler
  - ESLint/TSLint for code quality
  - Jest for unit testing the tool itself

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 CLI Interface

- Implement using native Node.js capabilities for simplicity
- Parse command line arguments with minimal dependencies
- Provide clear, helpful output at each stage
- Support the following key parameters:
  - `--url <url>`: Target website URL to crawl (required)
  - `--output-dir <directory>`: Where to save generated tests (default: ./playwright-tests)
  - `--headless`: Run crawler in headless mode (default: true)
  - `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging
  - `--max-depth <number>`: Maximum crawl depth (default: 5)
  - `--max-flows <number>`: Maximum number of flows to discover (default: 20)
  - `--timeout <seconds>`: Maximum crawl time in seconds (default: 300)
  - `--ignore-urls <pattern>`: URLs to exclude from crawl (regex)

### 3.2 Web Crawler Implementation

- Initialize browser-use with appropriate configuration
- Implement depth-first crawling strategy
- Track visited URLs to avoid infinite loops
- Capture DOM state before and after each interaction
- Identify interactive elements using heuristics:
  - Form inputs
  - Buttons
  - Navigation links
  - Tabs and accordions
  - Dropdowns and select elements
- Generate appropriate test data for form inputs
- Record user flow states and transitions

### 3.3 Flow Analysis Implementation

- Process raw interaction data to identify distinct flows
- Cluster related actions that accomplish a logical task
- Filter out redundant or non-meaningful interactions
- Generate natural language descriptions of each flow
- Create metadata tags for each flow (pages, actions, etc.)
- Present flows to user using simple numbered list format

### 3.4 Test Generation Implementation

- Create a templating system for test files without external dependencies
- Implement the Page Object Model structure:
  - Generate a base page object class
  - Create specific page classes for each unique page in the flow
  - Implement action methods corresponding to user interactions
- Generate test files with:
  - Proper setup and teardown
  - Appropriate waiting strategies
  - Meaningful assertions based on observed state changes
  - Error handling for potential edge cases
  - Comments explaining the test flow
- Use AI to enhance selectors for reliability:
  - Prefer data-testid attributes if available
  - Use accessibility attributes as fallback (role, aria-*)
  - Use stable text content where appropriate
  - Avoid brittle CSS selectors based on styling

### 3.5 Test Validation Implementation

- Execute generated tests using Playwright's test runner
- Capture and format test results
- Provide detailed output for failures
- Suggest possible fixes for failing tests

## 4. Data Handling

### 4.1 Crawl Data

- Store crawl data in memory during execution
- For large sites, implement progressive serialization to disk to avoid memory issues
- Structure:
  ```typescript
  interface CrawlData {
    startUrl: string;
    visitedUrls: Set<string>;
    interactions: Interaction[];
    pageStates: Map<string, PageState[]>;
  }
  
  interface Interaction {
    type: 'click' | 'input' | 'select' | 'hover' | /* other types */;
    selector: string;
    value?: string;
    timestamp: number;
    url: string;
    beforeState: string; // Reference to pageStates key
    afterState: string;  // Reference to pageStates key
  }
  
  interface PageState {
    url: string;
    dom: string; // Simplified DOM representation
    timestamp: number;
  }
  ```

### 4.2 Flow Data

- Derive flow data from crawl data
- Structure:
  ```typescript
  interface Flow {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    steps: FlowStep[];
    startUrl: string;
    endUrl: string;
    tags: string[];
  }
  
  interface FlowStep {
    action: string; // Human-readable action description
    selector: string;
    interaction: Interaction; // Reference to crawl data
    expectedState: string; // Description of expected result
  }
  ```

### 4.3 Generated Tests

- Output tests to the specified directory
- Create a clear file structure:
  ```
  output-dir/
  ├── pages/
  │   ├── BasePage.ts
  │   ├── LoginPage.ts
  │   ├── DashboardPage.ts
  │   └── ...
  ├── tests/
  │   ├── login.spec.ts
  │   ├── navigation.spec.ts
  │   └── ...
  ├── fixtures/
  │   ├── authentication.ts
  │   └── ...
  └── playwright.config.ts
  ```

## 5. Error Handling

### 5.1 Crawling Errors

- Implement timeouts for all browser operations
- Handle network errors gracefully:
  - Retry failed requests (up to 3 times)
  - Skip problematic URLs after retries
  - Log detailed errors for debugging
- Handle JavaScript errors on the page:
  - Capture console errors
  - Continue crawling where possible
  - Mark flows with errors as potentially problematic

### 5.2 Flow Analysis Errors

- Implement fallbacks for unclear flow boundaries:
  - Use URL changes as flow boundaries
  - Use significant DOM changes as indicators
- Handle flows that couldn't be properly analyzed:
  - Mark as "needs review"
  - Provide raw interaction data for manual inspection

### 5.3 Test Generation Errors

- Handle selector generation failures:
  - Fall back to less optimal but functional selectors
  - Flag tests with potential selector issues
- Handle assertion generation issues:
  - Implement minimal assertions for flows where expected state is unclear
  - Add comments suggesting manual review

### 5.4 Test Validation Errors

- Distinguish between:
  - Environment/setup errors (cannot connect to the site)
  - Test implementation errors (selectors not working)
  - Legitimate test failures (behavior changed)
- Provide specific error messages and suggestions for each type

## 6. Testing Plan
